**Description:** Create initial page templates for <span style="color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Vaccine Fairness & Equity</span> 
that align with the project's theme and purpose, and meet the requirements of the users.

**Goals:**

1. Identify the types of pages needed for the project: **Home, About, Services, Contact, FAQ, Map**.

2. Research similar websites to gather inspiration for the layout, design, and content structure of the pages.

3. Determine the layout and structure of each page, including the placement of the header, footer, navigation, and content areas.

4. Choose a design style that aligns with the theme and purpose of the project, such as minimalistic, modern, or traditional.

5. Create wireframes to map out the layout, content, and functionality of each page.

6. Develop the page templates using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, based on the wireframes and design style.

7. Implement algorithm using **Jupyter Notebook** and data from Kaggle using **MySQL**.

8. Test and refine the page templates to ensure they are working correctly and meet the requirements of the users.

**Scope:** The scope of this initiative is to create initial page templates for 
the project. This includes designing the layout, determining the content that
should be included on each page, and creating a consistent visual theme that 
aligns with the overall goals and objectives of the project. The templates 
should be flexible enough to accommodate changes and updates as the project 
progresses, and should be easy to use for team members who will be responsible 
for creating content for the site. Ultimately, the goal of this initiative is 
to provide a solid foundation for the project's web presence and ensure a 
professional and cohesive user experience for site visitors.

**Outcomes:**

1. Completion of initial page templates for all required pages.

2. Positive feedback from users on the layout, design, and functionality of the pages.

3. Meeting the project's deadline and budget for creating the page templates.

**Deliverables:**

1. <u>Design mockups:</u> This includes creating mockups or wireframes of the layout and design of the templates, which should incorporate the project's branding guidelines and visual identity.

2. <u>HTML/CSS templates:</u> This includes creating HTML and CSS templates that can be used as a starting point for creating new pages on the site. These templates should be easy to customize and should be flexible enough to accommodate changes and updates.

3. <u>Documentation:</u> This includes creating documentation that outlines the design and functionality of the templates, as well as instructions for using and customizing them.

4. <u>User feedback:</u> This includes gathering feedback from users and stakeholders on the templates, and making any necessary changes or improvements based on this feedback.

5. <u>Training materials:</u> This includes creating training materials or resources for team members who will be responsible for creating content for the site, to ensure they understand how to use and customize the templates.

**Milestones:**

1. First 1 day of Week 1: Assign the work to the team members.

2. First 3 days of Week 1: Identify the types of pages needed and research similar websites.

3. Week 1: Determine the layout and structure of each page, and choose a design style.

4. Week 2: Create wireframes for each page, and develop the page templates.

5. Week 3: Test and refine the page templates to ensure they meet the requirements of the users.

**Constraints:** 

1. <u>Time:</u> The templates need to be completed within a specific timeframe,
   due to external factors such as project deadlines or other constraints.

2. <u>Resources:</u> skill level of designers or developers.

3. <u>Budget:</u> The budget allocated for the project may limit the scope or quality of the templates that can be created.

4. <u>Technical limitations:</u> The initiative may need to work within technical constraints, such as limitations of the content management system or web development platform being used.

5. <u>Branding guidelines:</u> The templates must align with the project's branding guidelines and overall visual identity, which may limit the design options available.

6. <u>User requirements:</u> The templates must meet the needs and expectations of the target audience, which may require extensive research and testing to ensure usability and effectiveness.

**Assumptions:**

1. The templates will be built using HTML/CSS.

2. The templates will be designed to be responsive, meaning that they will adjust to different screen sizes and devices.

3. The templates will be tested and refined based on user feedback and stakeholder input.

**Risks:**

1. Delays in completing the wireframes and page templates due to technical challenges
or resource constraints.

2. Inaccurate interpretation of user requirements or feedback, resulting in page templates that
do not meet their needs.

3. Changing user requirements or feedback during the development process, requiring 
additional work and delaying the project.
