completion. This will involve identifying the project scope, understanding the 
project's purpose, identifying the stakeholders' needs, and setting realistic
targets for project performance.

**Goals:**

4.  Create a framework for monitoring and evaluating project progress towards the  objectives

**User Stories:**

1.  As a project manager, I want to define the project scope to ensure that the project stays on track and doesn't deviate from its intended goals.
2.  As a stakeholder, I want to understand the project's purpose and goals to ensure that my needs and expectations are met.
3.  As a team member, I want to have clear and measurable project objectives so that I can focus on the tasks that contribute to achieving those objectives.

**Dependencies:**

1.  <u>Stakeholder availability and involvement:</u> The availability and involvement
    of stakeholders can impact the timeline and effectiveness of defining project 
    objectives and goals.

    necessary for defining project objectives and goals can impact the timeline
    and quality of the outcome.

3.  Changing priorities and shifting business needs could require revisions to the project objectives and goals.

**Estimated Effort:** It takes *1 day* for all of the members gathering and make
up the project's scope and the team's policies.
