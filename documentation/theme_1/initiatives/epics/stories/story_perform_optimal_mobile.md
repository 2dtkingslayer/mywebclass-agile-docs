As a mobile app user, I want the app to load quickly and smoothly, so that I 
can easily access the information and features I need without delays or frustration.

**Mobile app (iOS) criteria**

*   The *mobile app* should be optimized to load quickly and smoothly on a range of 
devices and network speeds. This includes 
    *   Minimizing file sizes 
        
    *   Reducing the number of HTTP requests 
        
    *   Optimizing images and other media for faster loading. 

Additionally, the app should be designed with a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate, minimizing the need for excessive scrolling or clicking.
