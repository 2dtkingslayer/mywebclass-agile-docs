When I visit the website, I should be able to see a clear and visually appealing home page design that includes a brief description of the website's purpose, as well as links to other relevant pages such as the about page, FAQ page, and contact page. Additionally, the home page should include a navigation bar that allows me to easily access other sections of the website.

1. The home page should have a clear and concise header with a logo, tagline, and a menu bar with links to other pages.
