# Create a mobile app version

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create a mobile app for the 
vaccine distribution project, so that users can access important information 
and updates about the project from their mobile devices.

**Description:** 

*   In order to create a *mobile app* for the vaccine distribution project, the 
    project manager will need to determine the desired features and functionality
    of the app, as well as the target audience and their preferences. 
    
*   We use coding language *Swift* and IDE *Xcode*. 
    
*   The project manager needs to ensure the app complies with relevant 
    regulations and standards for mobile app development, and conduct testing 
    and debugging to ensure that the app functions properly.


**Effort Estimate:** 3 months from start date.
*   Building a mobile app takes more time because it is more difficult to more
    and the releasing process to *App Store* or *CH Play* is complicated.
    
*   # Furthermore, only Truong Dang and Trang Dang know iOS development.

**Assigned To:** Trang Dang, Truong Dang

**Priority:** 1.0 / 5.0. We need to complete the web app version first.

**Status:** <span style="color:red">Not Started</span>

**Notes:** Use *Swift* and *Xcode*
