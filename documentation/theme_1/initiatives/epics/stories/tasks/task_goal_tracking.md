# Regular Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create a project charter to clearly
define the project's purpose, objectives, and stakeholders, so that everyone 
involved understands the scope and goals of the project.

**Description:** 

-   The project charter will be a formal document that defines the
project's purpose, objectives, and stakeholders. 
    
-   The charter will include sections such as the project scope, goals and 
    objectives, stakeholders, risks and assumptions, and constraints. 
    
-   The project manager (An Tran) will work with the project sponsor and key 
    stakeholders to create the project charter. 
    
-   The project charter will be used to guide decision-making throughout the 
    project and to ensure that the project stays aligned with its goals.

**Effort Estimate:** [Provide an estimate of the time required to complete the task, usually in hours or points]

**Assigned To:** An Tran (project manager)

**Priority:** 5.0 / 5.0. Do this task **regularly**.
