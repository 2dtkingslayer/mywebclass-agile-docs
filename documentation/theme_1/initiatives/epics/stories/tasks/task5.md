# Implement algorithm & Test

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to implement and test my performance 
optimization algorithm to ensure that my website runs faster and smoother.

**Description:**

*   The *implementation of the performance optimization algorithm* involves modifying
the website's code to apply the optimization techniques identified during the
algorithm design phase.
    
*   This may include minifying CSS and JavaScript files, reducing the number of 
HTTP requests, optimizing images, and other techniques.
    
*   Testing the optimization involves using various tools to measure the 
    website's speed, performance, and responsiveness before and after the 
    implementation of the optimization algorithm.

**Effort Estimate:** 20-40 hours of development and testing
