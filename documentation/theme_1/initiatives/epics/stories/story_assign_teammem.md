As a team member, I want to have visibility into the overall project timeline 
and the tasks assigned to other team members so that I can plan my own work 
accordingly and coordinate with others as necessary.

**How to have visibility into the overall project using GitHub:**

1. Access the project repository and its associated project management tools.

2. Check their status on the project board or in the repository's issue tracker.

3. The leader can assign tasks to individual member and set deadlines, which will
appear on the project board and provide further visibility into the progress of the project.

4. Use the project's communication tools, such as comments on tasks and issues, to stay up to date
 on the progress of the project and collaborate with other team members.
