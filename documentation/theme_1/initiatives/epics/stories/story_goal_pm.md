As a project manager, I want to define the project scope to ensure that the project stays on track and doesn't deviate from its intended goals.

**Stay on track**

-   The project team remains focused on the original objectives and targets 
throughout the project's lifecycle. It ensures that the project stays on track 
and aligned with the desired outcomes, and any changes or deviations from the 
original goals are thoroughly evaluated and approved before implementation. 

-   By avoiding unnecessary changes, the project can maintain its scope, timeline, and budget while delivering the expected value to the stakeholders. This can be achieved through clear communication, ongoing monitoring and reporting of progress, and effective change management processes.
