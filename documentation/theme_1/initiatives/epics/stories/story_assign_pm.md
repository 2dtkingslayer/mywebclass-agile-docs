As a project manager, I want to be able to track the progress of tasks assigned
to team members so that I can identify any potential roadblocks and adjust the 
project timeline as necessary.

**How to track the progress using GitHub:**

1. <u>Milestones:</u> track progress towards a specific goal or deadline. The 
   project manager can create a milestone for each phase of the project and 
   assign issues to the milestone as they are completed.

2. <u>Issues:</u> track tasks and bugs that need to be completed. The project 
   manager can assign issues to team members and track their progress as they 
   are completed. Issues can be tagged with labels to make them easy to search 
   and filter.

3. <u>Pull Requests:</u> propose changes to the codebase. The project manager 
   can review and merge pull requests to ensure that the code changes are 
   consistent with the project goals.

4. <u>Project Boards:</u> allow you to organize and prioritize your work. You 
   can create a board for each phase of the project, and track issues and pull 
   requests using columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

5. <u>Insights:</u> GitHub Insights provides a variety of metrics and reports 
   to help track progress, including code frequency, pull request activity, 
   and contributor activity.
   
**Acceptance Criteria:**

*  <u>Completion of tasks:</u> The project's progress should be tracked based 
   on the completion of individual tasks, milestones, or deliverables, which 
   should be clearly defined and measurable.

*  <u>Accuracy of estimates:</u> The progress should be measured against the 
   original estimates, such as time, cost, and resources, to ensure that the 
   project is on track and within budget.

*  <u>Quality of deliverables:</u> The progress should be evaluated based on the quality of the deliverables produced, such as meeting the functional requirements, user expectations, or industry standards.
