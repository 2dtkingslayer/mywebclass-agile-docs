As a website owner, I want to optimize the code to reduce the load time so that users can have a better experience and the site can handle more traffic.

**Performance Optimization:**

*Optimization* is the process of making something as efficient and effective as 
possible. In the context of technology, optimization often refers to improving 
the performance of a system, application, or website. This can involve

*   Identifying and resolving bottlenecks 
    
*   Reducing resource consumption 
    
*   Improving responsiveness
    
*   Increasing scalability. 
    
The goal of optimization is to improve the overall performance of a system while minimizing costs and maximizing
benefits.
