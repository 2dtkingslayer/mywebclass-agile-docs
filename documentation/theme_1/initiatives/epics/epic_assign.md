# Assign work to members

**Description:** Assign works to the collaborators such that the works suit their major and concentration.

**Goals:**

1. Ensure that all necessary tasks are complete on time and to a high standard.

2. Ensure that each team member is clear on their responsibilities and is 
   working towards specific goals and deadlines.

3. Promote accountability and ownership among team members.

4. Track progress and identify any areas where additional resources or support 
   may be needed.

5. Identify potential roadblocks or delays and take proactive steps to keep 
   the project on track.

6. Ensure that everyone is working effectively towards the shared goal of 
   completing the project successfully and on time.

**User Stories:** 

*  As a project manager, I want to assign the work load to the 
team members such that all feel comfortable to well contribute and everyone is able
to support each other.

**Dependencies:**

1. Availability of team members

2. Skillset of team members.

**Risks:**

1. Miscommunication can occur if the project manager and team members are not 
   clear on the tasks assigned or if there is confusion about expectations. 

2. Lack of clarity can occur if tasks are not clearly defined or if the project
   manager does not provide clear instructions.

3. Inadequate skills

4. Resource constraints

5. Unforeseen events: changes in project scope or unexpected challenges

6. Conflicting priorities can occur if team members have other competing 
   priorities 

**Estimated Effort:** It may take *1 day* of gathering to assign the basic work to all team members and create the workplace.

**Business Value:**

1. <u>Improved productivity:</u> Assigning tasks to team members ensures that 
   everyone knows their responsibilities, deadlines, and deliverables. This 
   clarity helps team members to work efficiently and effectively, leading to 
   improved productivity.

2. <u>Increased accountability:</u> By assigning tasks to specific team members,
   everyone knows who is responsible for each task. This accountability ensures 
   that everyone is working towards a common goal and that there is a clear 
   understanding of what needs to be done.

3. <u>Better resource allocation:</u> Assigning tasks to team members helps in 
   identifying skills, strengths, and weaknesses of team members. This 
   information can be used to allocate resources more effectively, ensuring 
   that the right person is working on the right task.

4. <u>Improved communication:</u> Assigning tasks to team members helps to create a clear line of communication. It ensures that everyone is aware of what they need to do and when they need to do it. This clear communication reduces the risk of misunderstandings and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goal.

**Priority:** 5.0 / 5.0. Complete this step as soon as possible to start the project.
