# Performance Optimization

**Description:** Optimizing the performance of the website, including minimizing 
page load times and optimizing images and other multimedia elements for faster
loading.

**Goals:**

1.  Improve User Experience

2.  Increase Search Engine Visibility

3.  Reduce Costs

**User Stories:**

*   As a user, I want the pages to load quickly so that I can easily navigate the site and find the information I need.

*   As a website owner, I want to optimize the images and videos on my site so that they load faster and improve the overall performance of the site.

**Dependencies:**

1.  Available technology

2.  Server capacity and network infrastructure

3.  Third-party integrations

4.  User behavior

**Risks:**

1.  <u>Over-optimization:</u> go overboard and spend too much time or resources
    on optimization, leading to diminishing returns and decreased productivity.

2.  <u>Compatibility issues:</u> optimization techniques that work well on one platform or device may not work as well on others.

3.  <u>Loss of functionality:</u> require sacrificing certain features or functionalities that would otherwise be available.

4.  <u>Security vulnerabilities:</u> lead to security vulnerabilities if shortcuts or other compromises are made. 

5.  <u>Unintended consequences:</u> increased load times in certain situations, decreased reliability in others.

**Estimated Effort:** It may take *2 weeks* to think of the algorithm, build the code,
and repeat the testing process.

**Business Value:**

1.  <u>Increased conversions:</u> Customers are more likely to complete an action on a site that loads quickly and is easy to use.

2.  <u>Improved brand reputation:</u> A well-optimized website can enhance a brand's reputation and credibility, demonstrating that the company is committed to providing a quality user experience and staying current with the latest technology.

**Priority:** 3.0 / 5.0. Our website is new, so we don't have to attach much stress
on performance optimization.
