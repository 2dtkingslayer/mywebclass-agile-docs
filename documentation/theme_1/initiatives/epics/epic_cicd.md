# Integrate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices

**Description:** This epic focuses on integrating Continuous Integration and 
Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices to streamline the development and 
deployment process for the LMS.

**Goals:**

1. Implement Continuous Integration (CI) practices to automate the build and testing process.

2. Implement Continuous Deployment (CD) practices to automate the deployment process.

3. Streamline the development and deployment process for the LMS.

**User Stories:**

1. As a developer, I want to automatically build and test my code changes whenever I push them to the repository.

2. As an operation member, I want to automatically deploy code changes to the production environment without manual intervention.

**Dependencies:** 

1.  Availability of tools and resources for implementing CI/CD practices.

**Risks:**

1. Difficulty in integrating CI/CD practices with the existing development and deployment processes.

2. Lack of expertise in implementing CI/CD practices.

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day

**Business Value:**

1.  Improved development and deployment process for the LMS, resulting in increased efficiency and reliability.

**Priority:** 4.0 / 5.0.This is an important process for the project.
