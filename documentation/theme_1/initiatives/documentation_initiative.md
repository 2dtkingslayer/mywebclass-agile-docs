# A clear project scope through documentation

**Description:** Create a *project charter* to define the scope and purpose of the project.

**Goals:**

1.  Create a shared understanding of project objectives and goals among team members and stakeholders.

2.  Establish clear communication channels and protocols for the project.

3.  Define project roles and responsibilities for team members and stakeholders.

**Scope:** The project charter will include the project scope and objectives, 
key stakeholders, high-level requirements, project constraints and assumptions, 
and the project timeline.

**Outcomes:**

1.  A clear understanding of the project scope and objectives.
2.  A comprehensive project plan with timelines, resources, and budget.
3.  A well-defined project structure, including roles and responsibilities.

**Deliverables:**

1.  <u>Project charter:</u> A document that outlines purpose, goals, stakeholders, and scope of the project.

2.  <u>Requirements document:</u> A detailed description of the project's functional and non-functional requirements.

3.  <u>Scope statement:</u> A document that clearly defines the boundaries and objectives of the project.

4.  <u>Risk management plan:</u> A plan that identifies potential risks and 
    outlines the strategies to mitigate or manage them.

**Milestones:**

1.  Week 1: Initial planning and research
2.  Week 2: Outline and draft project documentation
3.  Week 3: Review and finalize project documentation with stakeholders
4.  Week 3: Implement project documentation in project management tool
5.  Week 4: Conduct project kick-off meeting with team members

**Constraints:**

1.  Limited time and resources for creating the documentation
2.  Availability of the team members for providing information and reviewing the documentation
3.  Access to necessary tools and software for creating and sharing the documentation

**Assumptions:**

1.  The team members have a clear understanding of the project goals and requirements
2.  The project scope and objectives are stable and unlikely to change significantly during the documentation process
3.  The team members are willing and able to provide accurate and timely information for the documentation

**Risks:**

1.  The documentation may not capture all the necessary information, leading to misunderstandings or delays later in the project
2.  The documentation become outdated if changes to the project scope or requirements are made
3.  The team members may not have the necessary expertise or knowledge to accurately provide the required information for the documentation

**Dependencies:**

1.  <u>Availability of key stakeholders:</u> The development of project 
    documentation will require input and feedback from various stakeholders, 
    such as project sponsors, team members, and subject matter experts. 

2.  <u>External dependencies:</u> The project may depend on external factors 
    such as regulatory compliance, vendor agreements, or other third-party 
    dependencies. 

3.  <u>Technical dependencies:</u> The initiative may depend on the availability
    and compatibility of technical systems, such as software platforms, 
    hardware infrastructure, or network connectivity. 

**Team:** All team members should understand clearly the project's scope and follow the rules.
