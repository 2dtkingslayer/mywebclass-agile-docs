**Task Title: User story with MAP**

**User Story:** As a person looking to get vaccinated, I want to see a map that 
shows me the location of nearby hospitals that offer the vaccine. I want to be 
able to search for hospitals by my current location or by entering my zip code. 
When I click on a hospital on the map, I want to see more detailed information 
about that hospital, including the address, phone number, and hours of operation.

**Description:** After entering the information, users are sent to Google Maps
page that display the health service's address and how to get there. Because it
is Google Maps page, it already has all information:
1. <u>Location marker</u> 
2. <u>Search functionality</u> 
3. <u>Filters:</u> Users may want to filter the results based on specific 
   criteria, such as the availability of appointments or the type of vaccine 
   being offered.
4. <u>Directions:</u> It can be helpful to include a feature that allows users
   to get directions to the hospital directly from the map.

**Effort Estimate:** It took 2 hours to complete a page implementing Google Maps.
