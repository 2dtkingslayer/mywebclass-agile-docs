**Task Title: User story with FAQ PAGE**

**User Story:** As a user who is new to the vaccine, I want to be able to easily 
find answers to common questions about the vaccine, so that I can learn more about it and feel more informed.

**Description:** FAQ page
1. <u>Common questions:</u> Start by identifying the most common questions that 
   people have about vaccine and vaccination process. This includes questions 
   about vaccine safety, efficacy, distribution, eligibility, and side effects.
2. <u>Clear and concise answers:</u> For each question, provide a clear and 
   concise answer that is easy for users to understand. Use plain language 
   and avoid technical jargon as much as possible.
3. <u>Additional resources:</u> Provide links to additional resources where 
   users can find more information about vaccine and vaccination process 
   (reputable health organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and 
   Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO)).
4. <u>Contact information:</u> Include contact information for the website or 
   organization so that users can get in touch if they have additional 
   questions or concerns.
5. <u>Easy navigation:</u> Make it easy for users to find the information 
   they're looking for by organizing your FAQ page into categories or sections.
   This can help users quickly navigate to the information they need.
6. <u>Timely updates:</u> Keep FAQ page up-to-date with the latest information
   about vaccine and vaccination process. Monitor news and updates from 
   reputable sources and update your FAQ page accordingly.

**Effort Estimate:** It took 12 hours to complete all detail of the FAQ page.
Furthermore, I need to keep the FAQ page up-to-date with the latest knowledge 
about vaccine so I have to revise the page monthly.
